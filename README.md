# History of the Fama-French 3-Factor Model
The Fama-French Three Factor model is a formula to describe the rate of return on a stock investment. Developed in 1992 by then-University of Chicago professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, it is based on the observation that value shares tend to outperform growth shares and small-cap shares tend to outperform large-cap shares. Jumping on those observations the two economists developed their three-factor model as an expansion of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Rather than just gauge market risk as the CAPM does, the Fama-French Three Factor model adds value risk and size risk to the calculation.
The Fama-French Three Factor model calculates an investmentâ€™s likely rate of return based on three elements: overall market risk, the degree to which small companies outperform large companies and the degree to which high-value companies outperform low-value companies.

# About The Project
Because this model is widely used in the field of accounting and finance, this program has been developed to perform calculations with high accuracy and to save users' time.

# Raw data needed to get started:
## You need an Excel file with the following raw data:
1. Names of sample companies written in the code with the title "Company".
2. Book value of each company written in the code with the title "Book Value".
3. Year-end market value of each company written in the code with the title "Market Value esfand".
4. Market value of the sixth month of the following year for each company written in the code with the title "Market Value tir" (This can be vary depending on your case, But this is not important in the code. You just need to have data for this).
5. Finally, based on what annual period you chose, you should have 12 months of monthly returns for each company (These are shown in the code with titles "1M" to "12M").
